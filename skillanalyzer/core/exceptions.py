"""Skill Analyzer exceptions.

This module defines custom exceptions for Skill Analyzer operations.
All exceptions inherit from SkillAnalyzerError for easy catching.

Example:
    >>> from skillanalyzer import Scanner
    >>> from skillanalyzer.core.exceptions import SkillLoadError
    >>>
    >>> scanner = Scanner()
    >>>
    >>> try:
    ...     skill = scanner.load_skill("path/to/skill")
    ... except SkillLoadError as e:
    ...     print(f"Failed to load skill: {e}")
    ... except SkillAnalysisError as e:
    ...     print(f"Analysis failed: {e}")
"""


class SkillAnalyzerError(Exception):
    """Base exception for all Skill Analyzer errors."""

    pass


class SkillLoadError(SkillAnalyzerError):
    """Raised when unable to load a skill package.

    This can indicate:
    - Missing SKILL.md file
    - Invalid YAML frontmatter
    - Corrupted skill package
    - File system errors
    """

    pass


class SkillAnalysisError(SkillAnalyzerError):
    """Raised when skill analysis fails.

    This typically indicates:
    - Analyzer configuration errors
    - Internal analysis errors
    - Resource exhaustion during analysis
    """

    pass


class SkillValidationError(SkillAnalyzerError):
    """Raised when skill validation fails.

    This indicates:
    - Invalid skill manifest
    - Missing required fields
    - Invalid skill structure
    """

    pass
